

The find command in UNIX,can be used to find files and directories and perform subsequent operations on them. 

It supports searching by file, folder, name, creation date, modification date, owner and permissions. 

By using the ‘-exec’ other UNIX commands can be executed on files or folders found.


syntax:
-------
find 
 [where to start searching from]
 [expression determines what to find] 
 [-options] 
 [what to find]


Options :
==========
-exec CMD: The file being searched which meets the above criteria and returns 0 for as its exit status for successful command execution.

-ok CMD : It works same as -exec except the user is prompted first.

-inum N : Search for files with inode number ‘N’.

-links N : Search for files with ‘N’ links.

-name demo : Search for files that are specified by ‘demo’.

-newer file : Search for files that were modified/created after ‘file’.

-perm octal : Search for the file if permission is ‘octal’.

-print : Display the path name of the files found by using the rest of the criteria.

-empty : Search for empty files and directories.

-size +N/-N : Search for files of ‘N’ blocks; ‘N’ followed by ‘c’can be used to measure size in characters; ‘+N’ means size > ‘N’ blocks and ‘-N’ means size < 'N' blocks.

-user name : Search for files owned by user name or ID ‘name’.

\(expr \) : True if ‘expr’ is true; used for grouping criteria combined with OR or AND.


! expr : True if ‘expr’ is false.
